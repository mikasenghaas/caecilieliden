This interactive data visualization explores how rising temperatures affect Antarctic icebergs. It translates sea surface temperature data and Antarctic ice mass loss over time into an engaging, child-friendly experience (ages 7-11). Using a change-over-time slider, visual metaphors, and interactive storytelling, the visualization communicates environmental data in an accessible and emotionally engaging way. The design was informed by audience research, iterative prototyping, and user testing, with a strong focus on mental models, empathy, and clarity.
