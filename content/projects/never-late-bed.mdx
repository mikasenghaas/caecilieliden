The Never-Late Bed is my very first Arduino project, and a small scale prototype of a bed that functions like an alarm clock. The bed has four ways of waking you up: loud noise, blinking lights, gentle shaking, and a tilt/catapult to get the user out of bed. The user sets and chooses the alarm, and when the alarm goes off it will only stop when the user is no longer lying in the bed. You can see a video of how it works [here](#).

The Never-Late Bed seeks to challenge the usual experience of a bed and explores how it can be manipulated and alternated. While the usual experience would be comfortable and relaxing, the Never-Late bed reverses this experience and turns it stressful and uncomfortable to disinvite the user from staying in bed when the alarm goes off.

The Never-Late bed is of course mainly a silly project and was made while I was learning learning about basic electronics and microcontrollers. It taught me about exploring input and output modalities in human-machine interactions beyond screens, keyboards and the mouse, and gave me a broader understanding of how I can explore with different digital materials.
