title: "Co-Designing an App with a Live-Action Roleplay Community"
year: "2025"
---

In collaboration with a live action role-play community in Copenhagen that hosts events for children, we designed an app aimed at making event check-in queues more efficient and less stressful for volunteers. Their existing check-in platform was confusing and generated frequent support requests which significantly increased the volunteers’ workload.

We focused on exploring problem areas and understanding what was most at stake for the volunteers which eventually informed the development of a conceptual design grounded in their needs, challenges, and working conditions.

## PARTICIPATORY DESIGN, PARTICIPATION & WORKSHOPS

We approached the project through principles of participatory design. This methodology allowed us to learn the realities of the live action role-play community while they were introduced to tools from our design practices. The process was split intro three overall phases.

In the first phase, we gained insights about the community by visiting their clubhouse and participating in a live-action role-play. Through observation and informal conversations, we developed an initial understanding of the community’s practices, roles, and challenges. The most evident challenge was the long check-in queues, which placed significant pressure on volunteers who were constantly required to guide and assist parents. Despite long queues, the parents themselves did not perceive the process as problematic. In contrast, volunteers were clearly affected, which led us to focus the phase on the volunteers and treat parents as a future stakeholder group.

In the second phase, we held a workshop with the volunteers to identify and prioritize different issues at check-in in order to gain a common understanding of what was most at stake. The workshop showed that the most central issue was the current platform/sign-up system that created frequent confusion among parents. Multiple parallel user flows existed depending on the user’s situation resulting in the volunteers handling some issues manually around the platform. The workshop highlighted the need for a simple solution that could be used under time pressure, with minimal interaction steps and fast scanning to avoid delays during peak arrival times.

In the third phase, we held another workshop and explored how a solution could look by imagining different ways of checkin-in through scenario-based activities. A wide range of wishes was expressed, including additional features and improvements to the existing system. Based on this input, we prioritized, together with the volunteers, the needs that directly reduced volunteer workload and deliberately excluded secondary features.

This process ensured mutual learning which became essential to shaping the final concept. 

## RESULTS

The result was a simplified check-in concept. While the early-stage prototype may not be groundbreaking in its form, its strength lies in how well it responds to the real, situated needs expressed by the volunteers. First of all, an app was chosen as the medium, as it allows participants to complete registrations in advance and enables fast, low-attention interactions for volunteers during time-critical check-in situations. The sign up, payment flow, and the user journey has been simplified, as to be seen on the flowcharts below. When signed up, a QR-code is generated, enabling volunteers to scan participants quickly at the event.  The app also provides a clear overview of upcoming events and a calendar view. A noticeable constraint of the solution is the little involvement of the parents, who would also use the platform. If developed further, they would for certain be included.
